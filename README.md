# z3puzzles
Models for various types of puzzles which allows z3 to solve them without you having to do any actual thinking! for a guide on how to use z3 please refer to the [z3 github repo](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

Each z3 file has the original puzzle either linked or described at the top of the file.

I hope these models get your imagination going and get you motivated to try z3 out yourself. I had a lot of fun getting z3 to solve these puzzles for me and I hope you will too!
